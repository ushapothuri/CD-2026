"""
Three-address code (3AC) -- TRIPLE representation. 

A "quadruple" representation of three address code IR 
(where every binary operation invents an explicit named temporary, e.g. `t1 = a + b`): 
a TRIPLE never names its own result. Instead, each triple is numbered by its position
in the program (0, 1, 2, ...), and any LATER triple that needs an earlier one's result refers 
to it by that index -- written as "(i)" in text form. For example, `d = a + b*c;` becomes:

    (0) * b, c
    (1) + a, (0)
    (2) c = (1)

A temporary's identity is just its position in the instruction
list, so it never needs a name and therefore never needs a
SymbolTable entry -- only genuinely declared source variables (a, b, c)
do.

Three triple class each a small class with a render() method 

    BinOpTriple(op, arg1, arg2)   -- op in {'+','-','*','/'}. Its OWN
                                   result is referred to by later triples
                                   as TripleRef(this triple's index).
    AssignTriple(dest, arg1)   -- dest is always a real declared
                                   variable NAME (a plain string) -- the
                                   only triple shape that writes to a
                                   named variable rather than producing
                                   an anonymous, index-addressed result.

`arg1`/`arg2` are always one of:
    - a plain variable name (string, e.g. "a")
    - a literal integer written as a digit string (e.g. "5")
    - a TripleRef(i), pointing at an earlier triple's result

Use TripleProgram to build a program -- its append() sets each
triple's `.index` automatically and hands back a ready-to-use TripleRef,
which is exactly what tac_generator.py's gen_expr() needs for a BinOp.
